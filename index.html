        One of the hobby's I have always been fascinated by since I was little is
        cars. This includes but is not limited to: driving a car or other motorized vehicle, watching other people drive them,
        and modifying them. Many people are able to turn this hobby into a career, whether it be as a 
        mechanic, a youtuber, or even a formula drift driver. There are many paths to go with this
        hobby, both casual and serious.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;font-size: 50px;">My Proudest Accomplishment</h2>
    <p style ="text-align: center;font-size: 25px;"> 
        Though I haven't talked about it much, when I mention the 
    car scene, I am also indirectly including the motorcycle scene as they go hand in hand.
    That being said, my proudest accomplishment is being able to ride a motorcycle. 
    I first started riding in the summer of 2019 and haven't regretted it since.
    The pure adrenaline I get from riding is unmatched and I wouldn't trade it for anything.
